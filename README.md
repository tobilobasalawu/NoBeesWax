## Coupons of the Day

This feature uses Reddit's API to fetch six trending coupon-related image links from the subreddit [r/coupons](https://www.reddit.com/r/coupons). These images are then processed by Nebius AI's API, which integrates the vision model Qwen2-VL-72B to extract the coupon codes and relevant details with high accuracy.

## Coupon Hunt

The Coupon Hunt feature empowers the AI model through a fine-tuned dataset and advanced machine learning techniques:

- **Dataset**: Created specifically for fine-tuning, this dataset is available on Hugging Face: [Discount Coupons Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/visharxd/discount-coupons).
- **Fine-Tuning**: Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct was fine-tuned using [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth).
- **AI Model**: The new model is accessible at:
  - [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/visharxd/coupon-generator-2)
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/visharxd/coupon-generator)

## Community

NoBeesWax‚Äôs community feature allows users to:

- Post their own coupons and details.
